"""Restore the underline the Reading & Writing questions ask about.

100 RW stems say "the underlined sentence" / "the underlined portion" and more
still (Words in Context, mostly) underline the word being asked about, but the
extractor never carried the mark: an underline in these PDFs is a filled rect
0.8pt tall drawn under the glyphs, not a font attribute, so it lives in
page.get_drawings() and nothing looked for it there.

This finds those rects inside a question's stem band, reads off which
characters sit above them, and wraps the same text in <u> in the stored
stem_html. A table's ruling is the same shape as an underline, so any rect
inside a figure cluster is dropped - that is what the "underlines" on the data
questions were.
