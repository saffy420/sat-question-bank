// One-off repairs to tools/aiq/*.jsonl, found by reading every question rather
// than by any structural check. Each defect renders perfectly and is still
// wrong to answer, which is why the validator and the audit both passed them.
//
//   1. Two grammatically correct choices. A Boundaries item asks which choice
//      "conforms to the conventions of Standard English", so a distractor that
//      conforms is a second right answer however poorly it fits the meaning.
//      Four items offered a comma-plus-coordinating-conjunction or a comma
//      appositive that is simply correct English - and two of the four said so
//      in their own explanation ("Choice C is grammatical"). The distractor
//      keeps its teaching point with the comma removed, or becomes a splice.
//   2. A stem no choice can complete correctly: a nonrestrictive clause the
//      stem never closes, three introductory modifiers with no comma after
//      them, and a transition item whose keyed phrase collides with the words
//      after the blank ("The remaining the other four were abandoned").
//   3. A stem that asks about "the underlined sentence" and underlines nothing.
//      The audit only tested for "underlined portion", so these three passed.
//
// Every edit is an exact string replacement and every one is asserted, so a
// batch that has moved underneath this script fails loudly rather than
// silently doing nothing.
